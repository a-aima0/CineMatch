HOW TO USE GITHUB:

1. when you open the project, firstly 'update project' to you can see the most recent changes
2. if you want to work on the project, ALWAYS create a new branch: '+ new branch' - make sure to click checkout box
3. make all of your changes and when it you are done, click 'commit'
4. tick the changes box and write a small comment about what you've done, click 'commit' at the bottom
    DONT click 'commit and push'
5. now click 'push' - it will automatically send changes to the github repo, DONT click create pull request
6. once the commit is checked for merge conflicts - all the changes are pushed to the main branch
7. now you can safely checkout to main branch: REMOTE > ORIGIN > MAIN : checkout
DO NOT CHECKOUT onto LOCAL, ALWAYS REMOTE.
